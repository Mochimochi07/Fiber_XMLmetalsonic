Fiber using XML about metalsonic

This is a fiber golang app about Metal sonic.

I remembered SOAP when eggman talked through metal sonic.

the "<>" gave me a little spice about function driven things like orders, commands, protocols and stuff.

It really does takes time to get the hang of the envelopes.

So it gave me a little fun about robotics, datascience and the web.

I wanted to learn more about SOAP because of security and easy customization since the error handling is already built in.
